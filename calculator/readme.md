# Modular Calculator

This is a simple calculator package that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project is structured as a Python package and includes unit tests.

## Steps that performed

- Create the Main Directory: We started by creating a main directory named Calculator. This serves as the root directory of our project.
- Create the Calculator Module: Inside the Calculator directory, we created another directory also named calculator. This directory serves as our calculator module, which contains the actual calculator functions.
- Create the Calculator Functions: Inside the calculator directory, we created four Python files: add.py, sub.py, mul.py, and div.py. Each of these files contains a function that performs a specific arithmetic operation.
- Create the init.py File: We created an __init__.py file in the calculator directory. This file is required to make Python treat the directory as a package. This file can be empty.
- Create the Tests Directory: Back in the Calculator directory, we created another directory named tests. This directory contains our unit tests.
- Create the Test File: Inside the tests directory, we created a Python file named test_calculator.py. This file contains our unit tests for the calculator functions.
- Create the init.py File for Tests: We created an __init__.py file in the tests directory. Like the __init__.py file in the calculator directory, this file is required to make Python treat the tests directory as a package.
- Create the setup.py File: In the Calculator directory, we created a setup.py file. This file contains metadata about our package and tells Python how to install it.
- Create the LICENSE File: We created a LICENSE file in the Calculator directory. This file contains the text of the license under which our project is distributed.
- Create the README.md File: Finally, we created a README.md file in the Calculator directory. This file contains documentation for our project, including a description of the project, installation instructions, usage examples, and more.
